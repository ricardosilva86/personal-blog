# Who am I

Hello 👋🏻! My name is Ricardo Silva, I am a Platform/DevOps Engineer living in the Netherlands, and I enjoy solving complex infrastructure and automation challenges. With a career in globally renowned companies such as `ASML`, `Mambu`, `Dexter Energy`, `UBS`, `Atos`, `IBM`, and `Porto Seguro (BR)`, I have been building expertise in cloud-native architectures and DevOps practices.

Through this blog, I share insights and practical experiences accumulated throughout my professional journey. As a Google Cloud Platform-certified professional and an enthusiast of Hashicorp technologies (especially Terraform and Vault), my goal is to contribute with deeper technical content (as much as possible 😁), focusing on practical solutions and engineering best practices.
