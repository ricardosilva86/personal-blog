# Who am I

Hello 👋🏻! My name is Ricardo Silva, I'm a Platform/DevOps Engineer living in the Netherlands, and I enjoy solving complex infrastructure and automation challenges. With a career in globally prominent companies such as `ASML`, `Mambu`, `Dexter Energy`, `UBS`, `Atos`, `IBM`, and `Porto Seguro`, I've been building knowledge in cloud-native architectures and DevOps practices.

Through this blog, I share insights and practical experiences accumulated throughout my professional journey. As a certified professional in Google Cloud Platform and an enthusiast of Hashicorp technologies (especially Terraform and Vault), my goal is to contribute with deeper technical content (as much as possible 😁), focusing on practical solutions and good engineering practices.
